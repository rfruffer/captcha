Fork is abandoned.
The fake button is rarely used, making the feature largely pointless. Additionally, the fork contains a bug preventing captcha from displaying for some users.

Telegram Captcha Bot
Telegram bot that validates new users that enter supergroup. Validation works like a simple captcha. Bot written in Go (Golang).

This bot has been tested on several supergroups (2000+ people) for a long time and has shown its effectiveness against spammers.

Fork information
Two fake buttons have been added, pressing on which the user gets banned.
Randomization of the button order. The original button for allowing access to the chat will never be the first in the list.
If print_success_and_fail_messages_strategy = "del" is selected in the configuration, the message about the user entering the chat is also deleted.
The user's first name (not @username) has been added to the welcome message.
Added the ability to disable and enable the bot for administrators using the /capcha command
Attack mode. In this mode, all new chat participants receive a temporary 5-minute ban. This command is useful during a mass invasion of spammers in the chat.
Added CAS antispam protection.
